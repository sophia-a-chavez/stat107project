This is a good start to trying to summarize data that can potentially address a very complex question. Without considering the nature of the question being asked, you are working with spatiotemporal data: these events occur at a specific time and place. As such, we have to spend a great deal of time understanding the technical subtleties of the data. For example, in taking an average over a specific time period, we are necessarily assuming something about the events that occur within and outside that time interval:

- Are years necessarily independent?
- Does measuring the events at the level of a year make the most sense? Or are there enough "changes" within some years to where a smaller scale makes more sense?
- What are the population sizes of the units of observation? Cities like Los Angeles have similar population sizes to some states.
- How densely populated are these regions? Most of Wyoming is wilderness with relatively few people in its cities compared to most US states.
- Institutions and government funding vary vastly across these states. The personnel and operating budget of LAPD likely dwarfs that of Cheyenne's police department. Similarly, it is far more difficult to enforce and justify quarantines in a place where most people's nearest neighbor is a mile away.

I would have liked to have seen more thoughtful reflection as to what the data represents, where it came from, etc. as well as a more quantitative analysis.
