# Stat107 Project

## Group: LCSB

### Members: Sophia Chavez, Carolyn Hsu, Leo Guzman, and Bryan Pham

#### Research topic:

Our group will analyze a dataset containing the reported fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2022. By comparing our findings to the people in power and/or the social movements throughout those years, our goal is to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.

#### Presentation Outline: (rough)

<<<<<<< HEAD
##### Intro ~
- (introduce research topic)^^^
Our group investigates the pattern and disparties of Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S which each member focusing on a specific aspect of the data to bring up meaningful correlations between the statistic on paper and the real world problem it presents. By leveraging the dataset, we aim to examine trends over time, assess the percentage of unarmed individuals among fatalities, and address essential demographic variables such as race and age.

##### Intro \~
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/main

-   Weâ€™ll be presenting an analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States between 2015 and 2022.
-   We used the FatalPoliceShootings_US.csv, which includes:
-   Victim demographics: age, gender, race
-   Police interactions (circumstances surrounding the shooting): threat levels, presence of a body camera, armed, manner of death
-   Our goal is to use this data to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.

##### Body \~

-   We found the average amount of shooting per year by race. What do the results mean?

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   Key Findings ~
-   Demographic trends: Proportionally, white people were more likely to be in fatal shootings in 2015. Followed by Black people and Hispanic people respectively.
-   The total amount of fatal shootings decreased during the span of 2015 to 2022 (from a high 986 and dropping to 280).
-   The average ages of victims in fatal shootings were mostly consistent throughout this time, with an average range of 36.6 to 38.1 years old.
-   It seems that the total number of fatal shootings were much higher without the presense of body cameras.
-   

-   Infer ~
-   **Review the key political events and social movements that shaped the United States from 2015 to 2022 (Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, elections, George Floyd, etc.)

-   If we focus on the Black Lives Matter movement, which was most active from summer 2016 to summer 2020, ???

##### Conclusion \~

-   What did we expect? What actually happened?

We expected to find strong correlations between the political and social environment and the trends of fatal police shooting in the United States. Specifically, we hoped that the fluctuation in death aligned with social/political movement and spatial movements. 

What we actually found was that the correlations between spatial movements during the pandemic had low or none effects on the number of fatal shooting while, the BLM movement during the pandemic did. While the number of fatal shootings in general, there was a decrease against unarmed individuals which entails the awareness around unwarranted police brutality. 

-   Were there any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States?

Yes, there was some correlations, but they were not as strong or as consistent as we initially thought. Evidence of BLM influencing the trend of police shooting, reporting practice, and systemic issues results in true.
