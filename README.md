## Group: LCSB

### Members: Sophia Chavez, Carolyn Hsu, Leo Guzman, and Bryan Pham

#### Research topic:

Our group will analyze a dataset containing the reported fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2022. By comparing our findings to the people in power and/or the social movements throughout those years, our goal is to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.

#### Presentation Outline: (rough)

##### Intro \~

-   Weâ€™ll be presenting an analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States between 2015 and 2022.
-   We used the FatalPoliceShootings_US.csv, which includes:
-   Victim demographics: age, gender, race
-   Police interactions (circumstances surrounding the shooting): threat levels, presence of a body camera, armed, manner of death
-   Our goal is to use this data to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.

##### Body \~

-   We found the average amount of shooting per year by race. What do the results mean?

-   Key Findings ~
-   Demographic trends: Proportionally, white people were more likely to be in fatal shootings in 2015. Followed by Black people and Hispanic people respectively.
-   The total amount of fatal shootings decreased during the span of 2015 to 2022 (from a high 986 and dropping to 280).
-   The average ages of victims in fatal shootings were mostly consistent throughout this time, with an average range of 36.6 to 38.1 years old.
-   It seems that the total number of fatal shootings were much higher without the presense of body cameras.
-   

-   Infer ~
-   **Review the key political events and social movements that shaped the United States from 2015 to 2022 (Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, elections, George Floyd, etc.)
-   If we focus on the Black Lives Matter movement, which was most active from summer 2016 to summer 2020, ???

##### Conclusion \~

-   What did we expect? What actually happened?
-   Were there any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States?
