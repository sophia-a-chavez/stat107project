## Group: LCSB
### Members: Sophia Chavez, Carolyn Hsu, Leo Guzman, and Bryan Pham

#### Research topic: 
Our group will analyze a dataset containing the reported fatal 
police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2022. By comparing our 
findings to the people in power and/or the social movements throughout those years, 
our goal is to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate 
and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.
