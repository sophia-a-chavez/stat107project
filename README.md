## Group: LCSB

### Members: Sophia Chavez, Carolyn Hsu, Leo Guzman, and Bryan Pham

#### Research topic:

Our group will analyze a dataset containing the reported fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2022. By comparing our findings to the people in power and/or the social movements throughout those years, our goal is to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.

#### Presentation Outline: (rough)

##### Intro \~

-   Weâ€™ll be presenting an analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States between 2015 and 2022.

-   We used the FatalPoliceShootings_US.csv, which includes:
-   Victim demographics: age, gender, race
-   Police interactions: threat levels, presence of a body camera, armed, manner of death

##### Body \~

-   

##### Conclusion \~

-   What did we expect? What actually happened?
-   Were there any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States?
