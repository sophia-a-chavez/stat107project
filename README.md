# Stat107 Project

## Group: LCSB

### Members: Sophia Chavez, Carolyn Hsu, Leo Guzman, and Bryan Pham

#### Research topic:

Our group will analyze a dataset containing the reported fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 through 2022. By comparing our findings to the people in power and/or the social movements throughout those years, our goal is to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.

#### Presentation Outline: (rough)

##### Intro \~

Our group investigates the pattern and disparities of Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S which each member focusing on a specific aspect of the data to bring up meaningful correlations between the statistic on paper and the real world problem it presents. By leveraging the dataset, we aim to examine trends over time, assess the percentage of unarmed individuals among fatalities, and address essential demographic variables such as race and age.

-   Weâ€™ll be presenting an analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States between 2015 and 2022.
-   We used the FatalPoliceShootings_US.csv, which includes:
-   Victim demographics: age, gender, race
-   Police interactions (circumstances surrounding the shooting): threat levels, presence of a body camera, armed, manner of death
-   Our goal is to use this data to identify any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States.

##### Key Findings \~

-   Demographic trends: Proportionally, white people were more likely to be in fatal shootings in 2015. Followed by Black people and Hispanic people respectively.

-   The total amount of fatal shootings decreased during the span of 2015 to 2022 (from a high 986 and dropping to 280).

-   The average ages of victims in fatal shootings were mostly consistent throughout this time, with an average range of 36.6 to 38.1 years old.

-   It seems that the total number of fatal shootings were much higher without the presence of body cameras.

##### Conclusion \~

-   What did we expect? What actually happened?

We expected to find strong correlations between the political and social environment and the trends of fatal police shooting in the United States.

-   Were there any correlations between the current political/social climate and the reported fatal police shootings in the United States?

    We found no significant correlation between the decreased spatial mobility during COVID-19 and the number of fatal shootings. Therefore we can not conclude if spatial mobility has a negative or positive impact on the number of Police fatal shootings. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the average fatalities per day and the increased disdain towards police forces during peak BLM movement periods. Therefore we can conclude the current political/social climate has an impact on the average number of fatal shootings per day by police officers
